	-> (???)

(SPECMTS3) SPE01505035: ENOXAPARIN SODIUM - incomplete SMILES
==============================
*** Open Babel Warning  in OpenBabel::OBSmilesParser::ParseSmiles
  Invalid SMILES string: 1 unmatched ring bonds.
	-> fixed: taken SMILES from PubChem: https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/16667706

(Spectrum_ED) SPE01505950: SUCRALFATE SODIUM - incomplete SMILES
==============================
*** Open Babel Warning  in OpenBabel::OBSmilesParser::ParseSmiles
  Invalid SMILES string: 1 unmatched ring bonds.
	-> fixed: taken SMILES from PubChem based on info in SuppTable_S2: https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/16698648


(Unique Compounds)
==============================
*** Open Babel Warning  in OpenBabel::OBBuilder::CorrectStereoAtoms
  Could not correct 2 stereocenter(s) in this molecule ()
  with Atom Ids as follows: 57 65
Warning: Stereochemistry is wrong, using the distance geometry method instead
	-> probably because of chirality notations of SMILES in SuppTable_S2, fixed by replacing with SMILES taken from SMILES .csv files
